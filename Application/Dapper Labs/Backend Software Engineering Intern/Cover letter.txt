My passion for blockchain technology aligns with Dapper Labs' vision, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to products like NBA Top Shot and Disney Pinnacle.

Beyond my technical expertise, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments. During my tenure as a software developer, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to implement complex features, enhance user experience, and troubleshoot critical issues. My adaptability and eagerness to learn have allowed me to quickly grasp new technologies, making me confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to Dapper Labs' cutting-edge projects. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work with Golang and GraphQL, as these align with my interests in building efficient, scalable, and high-performance backend solutions.
