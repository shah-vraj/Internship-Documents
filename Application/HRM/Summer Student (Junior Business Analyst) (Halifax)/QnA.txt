Answer size should be 3,500 characters or less. 

If selected for the Summer Student opportunity at the Department of Public Works, I would like to gain hands-on experience in a real-world public service setting, applying the knowledge and skills I have developed through my academic studies and previous work experience. This role would offer an excellent opportunity to contribute to the department’s operations while enhancing my professional development in areas such as business analysis, mobile application development, and data management.

One of my key goals is to expand my understanding of how large-scale infrastructure and public service projects are managed and supported through technology. I am particularly excited about the prospect of assisting with the development of tools and applications that aid in planning and operations, especially those that involve data collection and fieldwork using mobile devices and GIS information. I would love the chance to collaborate with experienced professionals in the public sector and learn from their expertise while actively contributing to ongoing projects and initiatives.

Additionally, I look forward to working with various datasets and learning more about their application in real-world planning and operational contexts. Developing and testing applications that integrate field data would allow me to combine my skills in software development with my interest in business analytics, helping me to further develop my abilities in both areas. This experience will not only strengthen my technical skills but also give me a deeper understanding of how technology supports decision-making processes in government infrastructure management.

I also hope to gain exposure to the overall workflow of a public works department, learning how projects are managed from a business analysis perspective. By working closely with teams, I hope to develop a deeper understanding of project management, budgeting, and how business decisions are informed by data and analysis. In turn, this will give me valuable insight into how I can apply my technical expertise in real-world business and governmental contexts, which will help me in my future career.

Ultimately, I am eager to contribute to the team, learn from experienced professionals, and expand my skill set. I believe that this opportunity will provide invaluable mentorship, helping me grow both personally and professionally while making meaningful contributions to the department’s mission of maintaining and improving Nova Scotia’s infrastructure.
