Dear Hiring Team at Thinkingbox,

I am excited about the opportunity to join Thinkingbox as a Front End Developer Intern. As a Master’s student in Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University with a strong passion for developing immersive digital experiences, I am eager to bring my skills in front-end development to your innovative and collaborative team.

With two years of professional experience in mobile application development, I have worked extensively with modern UI frameworks to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with experience in React and Vue.js, allows me to develop responsive applications that prioritize user experience. Additionally, I have a keen eye for design principles and UI/UX best practices, ensuring that the interfaces I develop align seamlessly with creative concepts.

Beyond my technical skills, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where creativity and problem-solving drive innovation. I am drawn to Thinkingbox’s culture of curiosity and continuous learning, and I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to interactive web applications that push the boundaries of digital experiences. I am confident that my adaptability, technical expertise, and passion for creative development make me a strong fit for this role.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm align with Thinkingbox’s vision. Looking forward to connecting.
