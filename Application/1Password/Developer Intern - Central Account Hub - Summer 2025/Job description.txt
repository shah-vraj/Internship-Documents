About 1Password

We all have important information we need to manage, and protecting it should be easy. Over 150,000 businesses and millions of people log in to 1Password to unlock smart, simple access to everything they care about. Our vision is to create a safer, simpler digital future for everyone, and our culture values simplicity, honesty and a human-centric approach to solving problems. Come help us unlock peace of mind so everyone can stay safer online.

Extended Access Management (XAM) extends beyond traditional IAM to secure the unmanaged applications and devices that are commonplace in the modern work environment.

The Central Account Hub focuses on empowering teams and businesses to unlock XAM’s multi-product paradigm and support 1Password’s vision for the future.

This is an exciting and dynamic opportunity to be at the center of a new multi-year strategic initiative for the company.

Remote by design.  1Password has been remote-first since our inception in 2005, meaning that we’re no stranger to building digital community and culture. With our teams fully remote and located all around the world, we stay connected through company-wide events, coffee chats, fun Slack channels, and peer-to-peer recognition through Bonusly — just to name a few. Our remote environment means that you have the flexibility to make those midday workout classes, take your dog out for a walk when they need one, and run errands on your own schedule. As an intern, you can expect to set core hours with your manager, and then work when you’re at your best. We all thrive in different conditions, so we encourage you to make your workday work for you! 💙

This is a remote opportunity within Canada. This is a full time (40 hours per week) position that will run for 4 months - May to August 2025.

What You Can Expect

Write efficient, scalable, and robust customer-facing features in one or more of our web (Typescript and Golang) and client (iOS, Android, or Rust) tech stacks.
Collaborate with people across the company like Product, Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and other Software Development teams.
Interpret data to design, build, test, and validate impactful solutions for customer problems.
Take a full stack approach to development by navigating everything from databases up to the frontend UI.


What We're Looking For

Confidence: A willingness to take on new challenges, and see them through to completion.
Humility: You're not afraid to ask "stupid" questions and make mistakes (as long as you learn from them).
Curiosity: You look for better ways of doing things, even if everyone seems happy with how they are.
Teamwork: We work together, and succeed as a team!


Bonus Points For

Backend web development experience with languages like Java, Python, Ruby, or Golang.
Frontend web development experience with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. We also use a lot of TypeScript.
Frontend iOS development experience in Swift using SwiftUI and UIKit.
Frontend Android development experience in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose and the Android view framework.
Backend experience with Rust.
Familiarity interacting with third-party APIs.


Even if you don't tick all those boxes, we'd like to hear from you. 

The most important thing you can bring to this job is the drive to dive in, get the work done, and fix root causes instead of treating symptoms. We believe in continuous learning and support professional development on the job with a budget to back it up. If you bring a desire to do the right thing for our customers, a sense of ownership over the product you work on, and a focus on shipping quality code, we want to hear from you.

This role will close on Friday, February 14th, 2025.
