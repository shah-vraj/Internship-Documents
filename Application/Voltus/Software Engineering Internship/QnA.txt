What is the coolest thing you learned in the past year?
Android - One of the coolest things I learned in the past year is how WorkManager in Android can be combined with Flow to efficiently handle background tasks like syncing data, even under network constraints. Understanding how to optimize periodic work while ensuring minimal battery impact gave me a deeper appreciation for performance-efficient software design. It was exciting to see how small optimizations can significantly improve user experience, and it reinforced my interest in building scalable and efficient applications.

iOS - One of the coolest things I learned in the past year is how to use PhotogrammetrySession in macOS to generate 3D models from a series of images taken by an iOS app. By integrating Firebase as a communicator between the two applications, I was able to enable real-time data exchange, allowing the iOS app to fetch and display 3D models as AR elements in the real world. This project deepened my understanding of computer vision, cloud communication, and augmented reality, and it reinforced my passion for working on innovative and impactful software solutions.
