Dear Hiring Team at Tecsys,

With a strong background in backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and relational databases, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Tecsys as a Software Development Intern. My experience in building scalable, high-performance applications and implementing CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI) aligns well with your development practices.

During my time as a Software Engineer at Simform Solutions, I optimized SQL queries for improved database performance and followed Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring reliable and maintainable code. I also collaborated in Agile teams to accelerate feature rollouts, reducing development time by 30%.

What excites me about Tecsys is its commitment to transforming supply chains through technology. Being part of a Scrum team that builds impactful solutions in healthcare and distribution is an opportunity I would value.

I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and discussing how my skills align with Tecsys’ goals. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Vraj Shah
